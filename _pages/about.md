Most activism takes place in and around the city of Nanaimo, located on Vancouver Island. In my spare time, I enjoy climbing, hiking, cycling, and exploring the island.

I'm always working on creative projects. I love to write and paint, and I play both the guitar and the drums. I used to play shows with my punk band pre-COVID. Nowadays, I spend my time writing and recording music in my home studio with local musicians.
